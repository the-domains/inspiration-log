description: 'A behind-the-scenes look at a mural for the Wilkinson Bros design studio, featuring an illustrative spin on a 1913 Indian board track racer (inspired by the Deus Ex Machina poster seen here): http://shop.au.deuscustoms.com/collections/posters/products/the-indians-v2 The goal was to create a warehouse vibe with the horizontal slats (and not paint the existing tongue-n-groove paneling).'
