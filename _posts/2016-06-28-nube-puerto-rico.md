  PUERTO RICO- NUBE is an artist from the San Juan suburb of Levittown. Growing
  up watching films by creatively ambitious directors, animation remains a key
  inspiration in her practice. Here I follow her around the side streets of San
  Juan and learn about what motivates her to paint large, ninja-like shadows in
  precarious corners of the city.
